So here will be listed all the files created and their purpose as in the long term, the project will be lengthy and it will be hard to maintain the track of all the files so pin this file in the code and here will be listed all the files along with the links (links for all the files specially code files is not possible). Don't forget to update this just in case you add or delete the file, add or remove a directory and assets too. Also update here just in case you change the purpose of the file, don't remove the old description of the things...
