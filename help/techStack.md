so here, i will be writing what we gonna use and learn and actually to implement.

**Frontend**
	1. HTML and CSS ( Tailwind UI framework)
	2. React (idk how we gonna use that but thats the better option compare to using JavaScript but i guess react is also made on js so ughhh )

**Backend**
	1. Nodejs but mainly with express js library
	2. MySql will be integrated via mysql2 or sequelize 

**Database**:
	1. MySQL (hosted on Planetscale or ClearDB)

**Website Hosting**
	1. IDK if we can host the website on github via git pages but if we can, that's def a good option in my opinion.
	2. Vercel
